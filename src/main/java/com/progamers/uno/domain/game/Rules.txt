Uno Rules!

The rules of Uno are as follows-
- Each player takes a turn, where they can play a card matching the colour, value or play a wild card;
- If there are no legal plays, you instead must draw a card and skip your turn;
- If you have one card left in hand you must declare "Uno!" or you will be forced to draw two cards;
- The first player to play every card in their hand wins the game!

Players can also play special cards such as:
- +2, the next player draws 2 and skips their turn;
- Skip, the next player skips their turn;
- Reverse, the turn order is reversed;
- Wild, you can select any colour;
- WildFour, you can select any colour and the next player draws four and skips their turn;
